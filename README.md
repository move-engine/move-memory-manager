# Move Memory Manager

This is the memory management component of the Move Engine.  It contains a high performance malloc/free replacement and having first class heap support (both of which are provided by `rpmalloc`), as well as an implementation of a "tagged heap", as described in Naughty Dog's 2015 GDC Talk [Parallelizing the Naughty Dog Engine Using Fibers](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022186/Parallelizing-the-Naughty-Dog-Engine).

Additional documentation will be added later.
